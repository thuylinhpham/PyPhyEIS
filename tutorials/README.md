## Readme 

- In the Excel file, the default values of parameters are given. The fundamental properties, amount of active materials, and diffusion geometry can be changed depending on your system. After putting some direct input parameters, the consequent resistance, capacitance parameters are calculated using the theoretical formulas.

- In the *Examples* folder, parameter files are given for diffusion, diffusion and intercalation process, as well as full transmission line model with/without Warburg interfacial impedance in the case of 1-dimensional particles. From that, you can apply similarly for 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional case.
